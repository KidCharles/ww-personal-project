            <p>Wayfaring Family.
 
 Conventional wisdom would tell you that you can pick your friends but you can’t pick your family. This is one of the many things that I reject from conventional wisdom. I know you can make lifetime friends, and I know that some of those friends can become your family.
 
 It is kind of strange looking back on how we all got started travelling together. Most of us are all from different backgrounds and from opposite regions of the country as well. We have California, Oregon, Texas, and Pennsylvania all represented. And me, I’m from a little bit of everywhere.
 
 We all met in Utah, and for some crazy reason we decided we wanted to go on a trip together, along with a few other friends. We didn’t really know where, and we really didn’t know what the hell we were doing in the first place. We had done a few weekend trips here and there, and somehow we were still friends. There were a couple of ideas tossed around, but the one that really stuck was New Zealand. We had kind of just thought about it, but it didn’t become a reality until we saw dirt cheap airfare to Auckland, New Zealand out of Los Angeles and we just couldn’t pass it up. I remember like it was yesterday. We all crowded around into an apartment pulling up tickets with Air New Zealand trying to all get our seats next to each other. And, anyone that couldn’t make it, was on the phone being walked through it as well. After a few hours, we got it all figured out and it became official; we were going to New Zealand.
 
 This was the first time that really brought our travelling group together. And,  soon after that we decided we wanted to share our passion for travelling, getting outdoors, and ultimately not being afraid of making the most out of life with you all.
